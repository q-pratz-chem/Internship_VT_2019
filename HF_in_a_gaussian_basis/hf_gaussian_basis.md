The goal of this Project is to carry out a complete LCAO Hartree-Fock computation on a molecular
system without using any external data other than the molecular geometry and a basis set. To simplify
our work we will only consider primitive (non-contracted) spherical (s-type, or zero angular momentum)
Gaussians; extension to higher angular momenta is straightforward but tedious and in practice it is recom-
mended that an existing Gaussian integrals library, like Libint, is used.
